Overview
--------

PySCSA is a Python implementation of Semi-Classical Signal Analysis, a method inspired 
by quantum mechanics for signal and image processing. It provides:

* 1D signal reconstruction and denoising
* 2D image processing with separation of variables
* Automatic parameter optimization (C-SCSA)
* Windowed processing for large images
* Comprehensive visualization tools

Key Features
------------

* **Efficient Processing**: Optimized algorithms for both 1D and 2D data
* **Flexible Parameters**: Easy control over reconstruction quality
* **Built-in Metrics**: MSE, PSNR, SSIM for quality assessment
* **Visualization**: Publication-ready plots
* **Well-tested**: Comprehensive test suite with 47+ tests
